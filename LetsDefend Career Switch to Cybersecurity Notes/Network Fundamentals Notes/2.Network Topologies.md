Network topology is a visual map to understand the physical or logical structure of a computer network. The locations of the devices and cables in the network are among the factors that determine the network topology. There are many benefits to having a network topology. For example, it is possible to see which other device(s) in the network will be affected if a device on the network fails to perform its task. If we are looking at a network topology of a large network, it is possible to see the subnets in the network and the devices it is connected to.  
Network topology is divided into 2 types:  
  
**Physical Topology**  
  
It is a type of topology in which all devices and components in the network are drawn in terms of their exact locations. Looking at this topology, it is seen which cabling is made over which paths and devices. What is seen in the drawing has a physical counterpart. For example, if there is a network device in the path from device A to device B, this device is seen in the physical topology.  
  
**Logical Topology**  
  
It does not show the exact location of the devices in the topology like physical topology. It often contains fewer elements than physical topology. Because data flow is important in logical topology. For example, data going from device A to device B may not be included in the topology if it passes over device C between device A and device B, and device C has no effect on the data that would need to be displayed on it. In this topology, it is the path of the data flow that is desired to be emphasized rather than the physical placement of the devices.  
Some topologies are described in the following topics:  

### Ring Topology

It works in a closed loop logic. The sent data travels around the ring in one direction until it reaches the destination. Each node passes the incoming data over it and ensures that it reaches the target. There is no hierarchical relationship between nodes.

### Star Topology

Each node in the Star topology is connected to a central node. All data flow is done through the central node. Star topology is one of the most common computer network topologies.

### Mesh Topology

It is a network topology where there is no central node and each node can be directly connected to the other. Mesh topology is not a suitable topology for large networks. It is divided into 2 types:  

## Full-Mesh

In the Full-Mesh topology, each node in the network is connected to all other nodes by cabling separately. In this topology, it is unlikely that the connection between two nodes will be broken. Because there are alternative ways of connecting.

## Partial-Mesh

In the Partial-Mesh topology, although each node is not directly connected to all other nodes, they are largely interconnected. Just like in Full-Mesh topology, there are alternative ways to reach the target node in case of disconnection.

### Bus Topology

Bus topology is a topology where nodes are located on a common path and data transmission is made with a bidirectional connection on this path. In the bus topology, each node receives every transmitted data even if it does not belong to it. Since there is no hierarchical order among the nodes, there is no transmission priority.

### Point-to-Point Topology

Point-to-point topology is the simplest topology and consists of two nodes connected together. For example, a passing call between two phones creates a point-to-point topology, or a direct connection between two computers creates a point-to-point topology.

### Tree Topology

Tree topology is a hybrid network topology formed by connecting star and bus topology. Tree topology has a hierarchical order and each node can have any number of subnodes.

In this part of the training, what the network topology is, its types and some network topologies are discussed. In the next part of the training, the subject of the “OSI Reference Model” will be explained.
