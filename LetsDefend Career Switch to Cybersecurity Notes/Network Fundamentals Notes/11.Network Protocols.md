### What is Network Protocol?

Network protocol is a set of rules that determine how to format, transmit and receive data transmitted between devices in order to ensure network communication regardless of the structure of network devices. In other words, network protocol is the common language for a flawless communication used by network devices within same network as well as among different networks. Communication between different network devices can only be carried out through the network protocols.

  

Knowing the structure and operation of network protocols is important in terms of security. For example, knowing the technical details of some important network protocols can be helpful when detecting threats.

  

### Types of Network Protocols

Network protocols can be divided into 3 groups:

**Note** : Some of the protocols mentioned in this section are explained under separate titles in the network training series.

Here are the most common protocols in these 3 groups:

  
**Communication Protocols**

- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
- Internet Protocol (IP)
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
- Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
- Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP)

  
**Management Protocols**

- Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
- Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
- File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
- Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3)
- Teletype Network (Telnet)

  
**Security Protocols**

- Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
- Transport Layer Security (TLS)
