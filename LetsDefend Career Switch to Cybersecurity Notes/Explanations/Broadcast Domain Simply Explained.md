### 1. What is a **Broadcast**?

- A **broadcast** is a message sent out to **everyone on a network** (like shouting in a room so everyone hears you).
    
- Example: When your computer first connects, it might send a broadcast saying _“Hey, who can give me an IP address?”_ and every device in that network hears it.

### 2. What is a **Domain**?

- A **domain** here just means a **boundary or area**.

### 3. So what is a **Broadcast Domain**?

- A **broadcast domain** is the **area of the network where broadcast messages can travel**.
    
- In other words: all the computers, printers, and devices that will hear that “shout.”

### 4. How are Broadcast Domains Separated?

- **Routers**: Stop broadcasts from crossing into other networks.  
    → So, each side of a router is a different broadcast domain.
    
- **Switches**: By default, switches don’t block broadcasts (everyone connected to the switch is in the same domain).  
    → But with **VLANs (Virtual LANs)**, you can split one switch into multiple smaller broadcast domains.

### 5. Quick Analogy 🏫

- Imagine a school with many classrooms:
    
    - If a student shouts in **one classroom**, only those students hear it → that classroom = one **broadcast domain**.
        
    - The walls (like **routers**) stop the shout from reaching other classrooms.
        
    - If you put dividers inside the classroom (**VLANs**), you can create smaller groups where only those students hear the shout.

👉 So in short:  
A **broadcast domain** = the group of devices that can hear a broadcast.

- Routers create separate domains.
    
- Switches can be configured (with VLANs) to also split them.
