### What is VLAN?

VLAN is a part of the network structure that provides logical grouping of devices in the network, regardless of the physical state of the devices in the network. With VLAN, each department within the organization can be separated into a separate subnet, and in this way, the devices of each department are located in a different network. For example, we can think of each VLAN in the image below as a separate department:

Network segmentation through VLANs can be implemented in many different ways. For example, as you can see in the image above, network segmentation can be implemented by using many switches in large companies. In organizations with fewer devices and departments, network segmentation can be done by configuring VLANs with a single switch as follows:

### Features of VLANs

- Since each VLAN is a separate broadcast domain, it contributes positively to network performance.
- Because VLANs provide network segmentation, it brings an additional layer to network security.
- It helps the creation of a flexible and modular network structure.
- Besides the advantages it brings to the network, it is also easy to configure.
- It can reduce network traffic and prevent congestion.
- As it can be configured with only one single switch, there is also support for configuration with multiple switches.
- It saves costs as it does not require additional hardware.
- It simplifies the management of physical devices.
- If the VLAN configurations are not done correctly on the switch, the network may become vulnerable to some attacks (VLAN hopping attacks).
