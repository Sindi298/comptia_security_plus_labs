### Virtual Private Network (VPN)

### What is Virtual Private Network (VPN)?

Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a technology that allows connecting to different networks through remote access. In networks connected using VPN, resources belonging to the network can be used just as if they are physically connected to that network. For example, a person working remotely joins the network by using the VPN service of the company in order to be included in the corporate network of the company he works for. In this way, it can benefit from the services offered by the devices that are physically connected to the corporate network. In addition, it can carry out joint activities on the same network with an employee who has a physical connection to the corporate network.

  

### The structure of VPN

In order to use the VPN, a VPN client application is needed first. The user is included in the remote network by connecting to the VPN server with the VPN client application. While connecting to the VPN server with the VPN client application, authentication processes are applied and a secure connection is ensured. In addition, the network traffic in between is provided in an encrypted way.
