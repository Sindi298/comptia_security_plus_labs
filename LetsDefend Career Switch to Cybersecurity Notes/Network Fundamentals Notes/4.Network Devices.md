In a computer network, there are network devices, each responsible for a separate task. Without these components in a computer network, the network cannot fulfill its task. Therefore, knowing the tasks and capabilities of network devices allows for solving problems in the network and understanding security breaches. In this way, a solution is reached by taking quick action. In this part of the training, information about network devices in an IT network will be discussed.  

### Switch

The switch is one of the network devices operating at layer 2 according to the OSI reference model. However, some switches with more manageable features operate at layer 3 according to the OSI reference model. The switch is the interconnection device and is used to connect the nodes that want to connect to the network. Sizes may vary depending on the number of ports on it.

As seen above, the switch device transmits the data coming from the source port only to the destination port, so it provides a data transmission that will not adversely affect the network performance. In terms of security, it prevents data belonging to two parties from reaching third parties, thus increasing data security in a way.

### Router

The router is one of the network equipment working at the 3rd layer according to the OSI reference model. The router is a packet routing device with highly advanced features that contains an operating system (IOS - Internetworking Operating System). It is network equipment used by placing it between two computer networks. For example, it is often used in LAN-LAN connections and WAN-LAN connections. The most basic task of the router is packet routing and thanks to this device, the networks are separated from each other (segmentation). In other words, it is one of the devices that separate computer networks from each other. It is a configurable device.

### Hub

The hub is one of the network hardware operating at layer 1 according to the OSI reference model. The hub device, which has a very simple structure, is one of the devices used to connect computers that want to connect to the network.

### Repeater

The repeater is one of the network equipment working at layer 1 according to the OSI reference model. There are only 2 ports on the repeater device. These ports transform the incoming signal into an outgoing signal and transmit it to the destination. It strengthens the weak signals on it and enables it to transmit data to longer distances. It is a device similar to a hub but does not have as many ports as a hub.

### Bridge

The bridge is one of the network hardware running at layer 2 according to the OSI reference model. The bridge performs packet routing by connecting two computer networks. Although it has a similar task to a router, it is a very simple device with fewer ports than a router. It is also separated from the router by working at the 2nd layer. The bridge can be used in LAN-to-LAN connections.

### Modem

Modems are generally small-sized network equipment in which the features of some devices such as switches are gathered together. It contains a small operating system. It is generally used in home networks to access the internet environment. It may have one or more ports on it. In addition, it is possible to provide an internet connection by using wireless devices together with the modem in wireless supported modems.

### Firewall

A firewall is one of the network equipment running at layer 4 according to the OSI reference model. A firewall is vital to network hardware located between the internet, which is considered an insecure network, and the existing network. The task of the firewall, which is one of the basic network equipment necessary to ensure the security of the network, is to block or allow traffic according to certain rules. Although there are many types, the most commonly used and known type of firewall is hardware network firewall devices. Having a firewall device alone is not enough to protect the network against external threats. Because attackers can even infiltrate networks with firewalls. The firewall must be configured correctly. Incomplete and incorrect firewall configurations can negatively affect network performance, as well as cause security vulnerabilities.

### Gateway

Gateway is one of the network equipment that can work at every layer according to the OSI model. The gateway is a network component that provides inter-network communication located between two networks. In other words, it connects networks. Although it is similar to router devices in terms of its function, it differs from routers with its ability to work in every layer. In addition, there are not only hardware but also software gateway types. Gateways are a gateway for other nodes in the network. Through this device, they can go out of the network and communicate with a node in another network.
